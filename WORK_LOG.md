| April 5 |    9-10pm     |                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                I tried to write abstract, efficient code. |
| Jan 26  |   1-1:45pm    |                                                                                                                                           We did work in class on the board and thought of potential ways to solve the problem. The initial way that I came up with was doing some recursion where you would input every possible number and subtract it from the amount until you reached the bottom. However, the main issue with this is making sure there aren't overlapping copies that are counted. |
| Jan 26  |  7:30-8:15pm  |           I thought about the hint that you gave us in class about starting by adding the possible coins and then at the end sorting the solution to the amount so that when more solutions came you could compare them to check if they are copies. I think a potential problem with this is that it would be pretty hard to put the solution you found into an array because there are solutions of different sizes. The best way would probably be an array of arraylists which might be hard to sort. |
| Jan 27  |   9-10:30pm   |                                                                                                                            I started putting into code the way I would go about the problem set. I made a recursive function that should in theory go through every type of coin and add it to a count until it reaches the target. It will add those into an arraylist and return a solution. The problem there is that there would be multiple solutions so it only return one when there are multiple. |
| Jan 30  | 10:15-10:50pm | I was able to finish the memoization solution to the problem. To start I tried using a method of a temp array to keep track of the coins you were using and using the size of that array to look up if it was already filled but that caused a lot of index out of bounds errors. I then switched to keeping track of the index of where the coins were and then eventually got it from there. Finally, I didn't realize that I had to make everything a long so I changed that and finished the solution |

The solution to this one felt a lot easier to be honest because it just makes more sense to me because of the theory we did in class about the memoization. The checks were pretty easy to implement so it felt pretty good to finish. |
