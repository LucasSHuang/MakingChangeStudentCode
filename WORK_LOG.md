The initial way that I came up with was doing some recursion where you would input every possible number and subtract it from the amount until you reached the bottom. However, the main issue with this is making sure there aren't overlapping copies that are counted. |
| Jan 26  | 7:30-8:15pm | I thought about the hint that you gave us in class about starting by adding the possible coins and then at the end sorting the solution to the amount so that when more solutions came you could compare them to check if they are copies. I think a potential problem with this is that it would be pretty hard to put the solution you found into an array because there are solutions of different sizes. The best way would probably be an array of arraylists which might be hard to sort. |

I made a recursive function that should in theory go through every type of coin and add it to a count until it reaches the target. It will add those into an arraylist and return a solution. The problem there is that there would be multiple solutions so it only return one when there are multiple.  |
